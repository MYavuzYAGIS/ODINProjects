## What was my take from this project?


This project was another milestone for me. Although I learned and practiced lots of techologies along the way, my biggest take was a very important skill that will, I believe,  help me when I have a job or work on future projects.
The skill I am talking about it `efficiency`. 

One may look at the screenshot and say that 'There is something missing or not purely identical in this work.' Well ,  this was deliberate.

Before starting the project, I set time limitations for myself. Then, I compertmentalized the project and sorted these compartments in order.

1) Write the HTML as barebones first then Style it.
2) Decide what to use when styling when there are multiple choices.
3) Since this is a learning practice, use the alternative you are the least comfy with.
4) Target  the `Minimum Viable Product` first. Do not chase perfection since the trade-off is `time`.
5) If you have extra time left, then do tweakings.


I must admit that this approach helped me a lot and I will try to implement it when I should.

Peace out.
