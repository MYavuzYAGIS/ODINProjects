## What was my take from this project?


This project was another milestone for me. Although I learned and practiced lots of techologies along the way, my biggest take from this very project was to
implement a very important notion. A notion that will, I believe,  help me when I have job or in future when I lead projects.
The notion I am talking about it `efficiency`. 

One may look at the screenshot and say that 'There is something missing or not purely identical in this work.' Well , because this was deliberate.

Before starting the project I set some expected project time for myself. Then, compertmentalized the project and sorted these compartments in order.

1) Write the HTML as barebones first then Style it.
2) Decide what to use when styling when there are multiple choices.
3)Since this is a learning practice, use the alternative you are least OK with.
4)Target for the `Minimum Viable Product` first. Do not chase perfection since the trade-off is the `time`.
5)If you have extra time left, then do tweakings.



I must admit that this approach helped me a lot and I will try to implement similar one when I should.

Peace out.
