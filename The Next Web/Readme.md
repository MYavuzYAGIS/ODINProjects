The Assignment link can be found here: `https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-responsive-design`
 
 
 This project is basically requires student to be able to clone the Next Web Homepage. Make it similar and make it responsive to different viewports.
 
 
 I used HTML, Font Awesome, Bootstrap and of course, CSS. I sharpened my `CSS Grid System` skills in the making of this project.
 
 I believe the end result is much improvable, but I targeted the MVP when starting, not the perfection.
 
 Down here you can see a SS from the end result:
