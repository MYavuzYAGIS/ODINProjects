I love Odin Project. It is always on point and giving only what is required as the assignment. No bloating.

In this assignment, I was supposed to replicate the intuit accounts' signup page.

To be honest, I felt like its not as easy as it seems. I mean all these positioning, coloring, padding.. But, with little bit of trick, lots of trials
and with the help of Allah I managed to do it.

what did I learn?

- putting logos.
- basic animations
- creating pro-looking forms.
- better looking buttons.

Here it what is looks like.
