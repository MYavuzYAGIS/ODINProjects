What is this?

this is one of the milestone projects of the Odin Project.
I was supposed to crate a login page. This page was required to be a replication of the intuit Account website login/signup page.


The requirement can be seen here https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/html-forms

the assignment is designed to earn the hands-on experience to the student and let him be easy with HTML forms.
