Well, creating the YouTube page was really a challenging one for me. To be honest I really took my time and lost lots of calories while doing it.

before starting my journey into Pc world, few years back, I had an idea in my mind and always thought that these kind of these are so easy.

I mean, ' Well, you do this and that, so it works like that , and that helps this.' I literally confess now that its all gibberish what I was talking.

Only one page took me lots of efforts and brought me to the level of leaving it few times.

I had to check other people's codes , get some inspiration and continue.

In this parcicular assignment of Odin Project, I learned video embedding and using thumbnails.

The odin project defined the aim as the following :
    'The goal here isn’t to produce an exact replica of the YouTube video page, but to focus on making the media elements show up. That means two things – embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays and showing little thumbnail images along the right side.

How far you go from there in terms of styling is up to you – some of you will already be more comfortable with CSS than others, so knock yourself out.'

So I believe that I nailed that, but I have to admit that I do not have the nerves to do it again.

Here it what is looks like :
