This project was SUPPOSED to teach me the visual hierarchy. It did. amazingly. But I spent literally hours and hours on it 
because of one mistake: not reading the requirements. The assignment was requiring me to design only the black-white blueprint of the website.
but since I just hopped on it, I took my all time to color it, style it, pad it, all sort of things that will make it look like the original site.

If you want to know how I felt during the project, just go ahead and read the comments and strings I put on the page while filling it.

Anywho, it was a nice design and nice pain. I learned LOOOTS of things.

- semi-pro styling
- nice boxing
- designing in a visually apalling way
- using gradients and lots more.


If you want to see the end product, look down.
