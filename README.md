# The Odin Project - HTML & CSS Section

### What is this Repository?

  This repository harbors the soluttions to the HTML & CSS section of The Odin Project's assignments. The link to the section is <https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css>
  
  From beginning to the end, I tried to follow some set of rules upon finishing the assignment and committing them.
  
  I organized them in folders, added Readme files to each one of them which also contains Screenshots for the respective projects, finally I added a small blogpost
  in which I talked about why that particular project meant to me and how did I benefit from it.
  
  In any case, I am attaching screenshots also the the this generic Readme post so the visitor can know beforehand what (s)/he will find.
