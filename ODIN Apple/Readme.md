What is this?

This task was assigned to the Odiner students who follow HTML & CSS module as a practice module.
The main point here is to replicate the Apple's webpage design that was launched to premier iPhone 5s. 
On contrary to today, in those days the Apple webpages were rather basic and on point. I had to navigate to the 
wayback machine, fetch the cached Apple page and replicate it. 

Here is the target page : https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/
