In this project, the student was expected to rebuild/replicate the main webpage of Apple.com back at 2014s. 
The main webpage premiers the new shiny iPhone , iPhone 5s, which was also my first iPhone.
This particular Odin project was the least demanding of all, at least this was my cleanest project. 
Actually I was able to finish it in 2 hours of time I suppose.
In this project, the student is expected to showcase his skills in:
- using basic gradient effects
- using background imaging
- positioning the auxillary images.
-creating a good looking navbar.

Here it how it looks like :
