## About this Project:

This project is one of the final milestone assignments of The Odin Project HTML & CSS module.  

In this assignment, I replicated the layout of `newsweek.com` using Bootstrap4, Flexbox, and Grid System.

For image placeholders, I used Lorem Picsum (`https://picsum.photos/`), thus, in every cache-cleared reload, the images change while
keeping fidelity to their dimensions.

For the text placeholders, I put some arbitrary text and headers.

This website is also designed to be a responsive website.

Heartfelt thanks to `The Odin Project`
