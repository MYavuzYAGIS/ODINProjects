### <My Blogpost/>
This project was an important one for at least 2 aspects for me :
By finishing `The Odin Project`'s Bootstrap4 assignment, I could actually replicate a worldwide renown website by using the same technology they used.
Thus, this indeed boosted my confidence.
Secondly, particularly this project was an ice-breaker between me and lovely CSS. During this assignment I made lots of research, experimented different methods
in order to achieve the desired end. 
For example, I used Grid system in some sections and used flexbox in some others in order to practice both of the technologies and be able to pull up the task.

One another thing I came to realize is that, albeit frameworks like Bootstrap are designed with aim to ease the way and reduce the workload, the taste of pure CSS
is somewhat better, in my humble opinion.

I really enjoyed from beginning to the end during this assignment. I could do better, but I need also to learn to be satisfied with mere `OK` and keep continue.

Thanks you.
